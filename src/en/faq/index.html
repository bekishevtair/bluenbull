                  All open positions are automatically rolled over or swapped over to the next business day. Traditionally, all spot trades in the Forex market are performed for a period of two working days (starting when the delivery of the transaction takes place). In order to avoid the delivery of the trade, the positions are automatically closed for the original trade date and reopened for the next trade date. To give the maximum advantage to our clients, the open and close rates of the rollover are kept the same as the open position rate. A premium is then added or subtracted based on the difference in interest rate between the two currencies being traded.

                  Clients can trade using a leverage of up to 500:1, depending on the asset they wish to trade and the size of the trade. Leverage of 500:1 means that a client is able to open a position, which is up to 500 times the size of his or her deposit. For example, if a client has deposited $1,000 he or she will be able to open a trade up to $500,000 in value.

You can also scan and email the request form to: <a href="mailto:support@bluenbull.com" class="txt tw-600">support@bluenbull.com</a>. In order to process your withdrawal request in a quick and efficient manner, please refer to the following guidelines:

                    <li>Withdrawal requests are usually processed within three business days of receipt of all required documentation.</li>
                    <li>Funds can be transferred directly to your bank account by wire transfer or returned to your credit card. However, a withdrawal can only be made using the exact same method you used for depositing. For example, if you deposited using a specific credit card, your funds can only be returned to that same credit card.</li>
                    <li>In order to withdraw funds from your account you must maintain your margin requirements in case you have open positions. If you request a withdrawal of funds from your account and we cannot comply without closing some part of your open positions, we will not be able to fulfill your request until you have closed sufficient positions to enable your withdrawal.</li>
                    <li>Please Note: In compliance with international anti-money laundering regulations, BLUEnBULL is allowed to transfer funds only to a bank account or a credit card bearing your name which was used for your initial deposit.

                  It is important to BLUEnBULL to ensure your funds are transferred promptly and efficiently. Regular money transfers take approximately three to six business days for approval; however, please keep in mind that there are several factors which might affect the speed in which your account is credited/ debited. These factors include, but are not limited to, the specific service you use to wire/ request funds.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Approved wire transfer withdrawals are forwarded to our bank on the day of their approval, and are usually sent out from our bank the same day. Wire transfers often make their way between several banks in several countries, and this can take a little longer, as foreign financial institutions usually require a few working days to remit funds around the world. Once processed, for any withdrawal via bank wire transfer or credit card, please allow up to 7 business days for the funds to reach your bank account. Please Note:

                  Margin call is at 60% of margin level. If you reach margin call, then you will be addressed either to close some of your open positions or make deposit to strengthen your current open positions.

                  A Trailing Stop is a stop-loss order that automatically adjusts itself as the market rate moves in the direction of your open position. The trailing price literally trails behind rising prices, allowing you to capture more profits while ensuring that if prices suddenly drop you are still protected by the automatic Stop-Loss order.

                  <br><br>
                  Important Note for MetaTrader 5 Platform: Since Trailing Stop works on the client terminal side, unlike Stop Loss and Take Profit that work on the server side, it won’t work if the client terminal is closed. If the client terminal is closed, only the Stop Loss that was placed by Trailing Stop before the terminal was closed can trigger.

                  The spread is the difference between the bid price (selling price) and the ask price (buying price). Example: If the quote for the EUR/USD pair is 1.2910 against 1.2913 then the spread is 3 pips.

                  Stop Loss orders are used to reduce risk by closing a losing trade once a market passes a trigger value pre-determined by the trader. BLUEnBULL will do its best to fill your trade at the price requested. However, because the order will close your trade at the best available price once activated, the Stop Loss is exposed to a gapping market. This means BLUEnBULL cannot guarantee a Stop Loss.

                  A rollover is when interest is paid or deducted from open positions. Trading currencies always involves two different currencies with their own individual interest rate. When you buy a currency that has a higher interest rate than the sold currency, you will be paid interest.

                  However, when you buy a currency with a lower interest rate than the sold currency you will pay interest, and money will be deducted from your account. A rollover applies only to overnight trades.
