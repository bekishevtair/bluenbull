            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em"><strong>RISK DISCLAIMER</strong></h2>
            In consideration of ComfyFX (“<b>ComfyFX</b>”) agreeing to enter into
            over-the-counter (“<b>OTC</b>”) contracts for differences (“<b>CFDs</b>”) and
            foreign exchange contracts (“<b>FX Contracts</b>”) with the undersigned
            (hereinafter referred to as the “<b>Customer</b>”, “<b>you</b>”,
            “<b>your</b>”), Customer acknowledges, understands and agrees that:
            <b>Trading Is Very Speculative and Risky</b>.
            <b
              >Trading CFDs and FX Contracts is highly speculative, involves a significant
              risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors but only for those
              customers who:</b
            >
            <ul type="A">
              <li>
                understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks
                involved;
              </li>
              <li>
                are experienced and knowledgeable about trading in derivatives and in
                underlying asset types;
              </li>
              <li>
                are financially able to assume losses significantly in excess of margin or
                deposits because investors may lose the total value of the contract not
                just the margin or the deposit.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Neither CFDs nor FX Contracts are appropriate investments for retirement
            funds. CFD and FX transactions are among the riskiest types of investments and
            can result in large losses. Customer represents, warrants and agrees that
            Customer understands these risks, is willing and able, financially and
            otherwise, to assume the risks of trading CFDs and FX Contracts and that the
            loss of Customer’s entire account balance will not change Customer’s
            lifestyle.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em">
              <b>Risks Related to Long CFD positions, i.e. for Purchasers of CFDs</b>
            </h4>
            Being long in CFD means you are buying the CFDs on the market by speculating
            that the market price of the underlying will rise between the time of the
            purchase and sale. As owner of a long position, you will generally make a
            profit if the market price of the underlying rises whilst your CFD long
            position is open. On the contrary, you will generally suffer a loss, if the
            market price of the underlying falls whilst your CFD long position is open.
            Your potential loss may therefore be bigger than the initial margin deposited.
            In addition, you might suffer a loss due to the closing of your position, in
            case you do not have enough liquidity for the margin on your account in order
            to maintain your position open.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em">
              <b>Risks Related to short CFD positions, i.e. for sellers of CFDs</b>
            </h4>
            Being short in CFD means you are selling the CFDs on the market by speculating
            that the market price of the underlying will fall between the time of the
            purchase and sale. As owner of a short position, you will generally make a
            profit if the market price of the underlying falls whilst your CFD short
            position is open. On the contrary, you will generally suffer a loss, if the
            market price of the underlying rises whilst your CFD short position is open.
            Your potential loss may therefore be bigger than the initial margin deposited.
            In addition, you might suffer a loss due to the closing of your position, in
            case you do not have enough liquidity for the margin on your account in order
            to maintain your position open.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em">
              <b>High Leverage And Low Margin Can Lead To Quick Losses</b>
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The high degree of “gearing” or “leverage” is a particular feature of both
                CFDs and FX Contracts. The effect of leverage makes investing in CFDs
                riskier than investing in the underlying asset.
              </li>
              <li>
                This stems from the margining system applicable to CFDs which generally
                involves a small deposit relative to the size of the transaction, so that
                a relatively small price movement in the underlying asset can have a
                disproportionately dramatic effect on your trade. This can be both
                advantageous and disadvantageous. A small price movement in your favour
                can provide a high return on the deposit, however, a small price movement
                against you may result in significant losses. Your losses will never
                exceed the balance of your account, which is balanced to zero, if the
                losses are higher than the amount deposited. Such losses can occur
                quickly. The greater the leverage, the greater the risk. The size of
                leverage therefore partly determines the result of the investment.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Margin Requirements</b></h4>
            Customer must maintain the minimum margin requirement on their open positions
            at all times. It is Customer’s responsibility to monitor his/her account
            balance. Customer may receive a margin call to deposit additional cash if the
            margin in the account concerned is too low. ComfyFX has the right to liquidate
            any or all open positions whenever the minimum margin requirement is not
            maintained and this may result in Customer’s CFDs or FX Contracts being closed
            at a loss for which you will be liable.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Spread</b></h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The difference between our bid price and our ask price is “Our Spread”.
                Our Spreads are set in our absolute discretion, since we are acting as
                market maker, and any changes are effective immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                Information in relation to Our Spread, leverage, rollover fees and trading
                hours for each market is stated in CFD Trading Conditions and FX Trading
                Conditions pages of ComfyFX’s website.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Cash Settlement</b></h4>
            Customer understands that CFD and FX Contracts can only be settled in cash and
            the difference between the buying and selling price partly determines the
            result of the investment.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Conflicts of Interest</b></h4>
            ComfyFX is counterparty to all Transactions entered into under the Customer
            Agreement and, as such, ComfyFX’s interests may be in conflict with yours. Our
            Conflicts of Interest Policy is available at ComfyFX’s website.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>OTC Transactions</b></h4>
            When trading CFDs or FX Contracts with us, such transactions will not be
            executed on a recognized or designated investment exchange and are known as
            OTC transactions. All positions entered into with us must be closed with us
            and cannot be closed with any other entity. OTC transactions may involve
            greater risk than investing in on-exchange contracts because there is no
            exchange market on which to close out an open position. It may be impossible
            to liquidate an existing position, to assess the value of the position arising
            from an OTC transaction or to assess the exposure to risk. Bid prices and ask
            prices may not be quoted by us, based on best execution policies applicable in
            the market. There is no central clearing and no guarantee by any other party
            of ComfyFX’s payment obligations to the Customer, thus Customer is exposed to
            credit risk with ComfyFX. Customer must look only to ComfyFX’s for performance
            of all contracts in Customer’s account and for return of any margin or
            collateral.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em">
              <b
                >Prices, Margin And Valuations Are Set By ComfyFX And May Be Different
                From Prices Reported Elsewhere</b
              >
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                ComfyFX will provide prices to be used in trading, valuation of Customer
                positions and determination of Margin requirements in accordance with its
                Trading Policies and Procedures and Market Information Sheets. The
                performance of your CFD or FX Contract will depend on the prices set by
                ComfyFX and market fluctuations in the underlying asset to which your
                contract relates. Each underlying asset therefore carries specific risks
                that affect the result of the CFD concerned.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our prices for a given market are calculated by reference to the price of
                the relevant underlying asset which we obtain from third party external
                reference sources or exchanges. For our CFD and FX Contracts, we obtain
                price data from wholesale market participants. Although ComfyFX expects
                that these prices will be reasonably related to prices available in the
                market, ComfyFX’s prices may vary from prices available to banks and other
                market participants. ComfyFX has considerable discretion in setting and
                collecting margin. ComfyFX is authorized to convert funds in Customer’s
                account for margin into and from such foreign currency at a rate of
                exchange determined by ComfyFX in its sole discretion on the basis of
                then-prevailing money market rates.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Rights to Underlying Assets</b></h4>
            You have no rights or obligations in respect of the underlying instruments or
            assets relating to your CFDs or FX Contracts. The Customer understands that
            CFDs can have different underlying assets, such as stocks, indices, currencies
            and commodities, as specified in CFD Trading Conditions and FX Trading
            Conditions pages of ComfyFX’s website.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Currency Risk</b></h4>
            Investing in FX Contracts and CFDs with an underlying asset listed in a
            currency other than your base currency entails a currency risk, due to the
            fact that when the CFD or FX Contract is settled in a currency other than your
            base currency, the value of your return may be affected by its conversion into
            the base currency.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em">
              <b>One Click Trading And Immediate Execution</b>
            </h4>
            ComfyFX’s Online Trading System provides immediate transmission of Customer’s
            order once Customer enters the notional amount and clicks “Buy/Sell.” This
            means that there is no opportunity to review the order after clicking
            “Buy/Sell” and Market Orders cannot be cancelled or modified. This feature may
            be different from other trading systems you have used. Customer should utilize
            the Demo Trading System to become familiar with the Online Trading System
            before actually trading online with ComfyFX. Customer acknowledges and agrees
            that by using ComfyFX’s Online Trading System, Customer agrees to the
            one-click system and accepts the risk of this immediate transmission/execution
            feature.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em">
              <b>Telephone Orders And Immediate Execution</b>
            </h4>
            Market Orders executed over the telephone through the ComfyFX Trading Desk are
            completed when the ComfyFX’s telephone operator says “deal” or “done”
            following Customer’s placing of an order. Upon such confirmation of the
            telephone operator, Customer has bought or sold and cannot cancel the Market
            Order. By placing Market Orders through the ComfyFX Trading Desk, Customer
            acknowledges and agrees to such immediate execution and accepts the risk of
            this immediate execution feature.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em">
              <b>ComfyFX Is Not An Adviser Or A Fiduciary To Customer</b>
            </h4>
            Where ComfyFX provides generic market recommendations, such generic
            recommendations do not constitute a personal recommendation or investment
            advice and have not considered any of your personal circumstances or your
            investment objectives, nor is it an offer to buy or sell, or the solicitation
            of an offer to buy or sell, any Foreign Exchange Contracts or Cross Currency
            Contracts. Each decision by Customer to enter into a CFD or FX Contract with
            ComfyFX and each decision as to whether a transaction is appropriate or proper
            for Customer, is an independent decision made by the Customer. ComfyFX is not
            acting as an advisor or serving as a fiduciary to Customer. Customer agrees
            that 2ComfyFX has no fiduciary duty to Customer and no liability in connection
            with and is not responsible for any liabilities, claims, damages, costs and
            expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with Customer
            following ComfyFX’s generic trading recommendations or taking or not taking
            any action based upon any generic recommendation or information provided by
            ComfyFX.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Recommendations Are Not Guaranteed</b></h4>
            The generic market recommendations provided by ComfyFX are based solely on the
            judgment of ComfyFX’s personnel and should be considered as such. Customer
            acknowledges that Customer enters into any Transactions relying on Customer’s
            own judgment. Any market recommendations provided are generic only and may or
            may not be consistent with the market positions or intentions of ComfyFX
            and/or its affiliates. The generic market recommendations of ComfyFX are based
            upon information believed to be reliable, but ComfyFX cannot and does not
            guarantee the accuracy or completeness thereof or represent that following
            such generic recommendations will reduce or eliminate the risk inherent in
            trading CFDs and/or FX Contracts.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>No Guarantees Of Profit</b></h4>
            There are no guarantees of profit nor of avoiding losses when trading CFDs and
            FX Contracts. Customer has received no such guarantees from ComfyFX or from
            any of its representatives. Customer is aware of the risks inherent in trading
            CFDs and FX Contracts and is financially able to bear such risks and withstand
            any losses incurred.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em">
              <b>Customer May Not Be Able To Close Open Positions</b>
            </h4>
            Due to market conditions which may cause any unusual and rapid market price
            fluctuations, or other circumstances, ComfyFX may be unable to close out
            Customer’s position at the price specified by Customer and the risk controls
            imposed by ComfyFX might not work and Customer agrees that ComfyFX will bear
            no liability for a failure to do so.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Internet Trading</b></h4>
            When Customer trades online (via the internet), ComfyFX shall not be liable
            for any claims, losses, damages, costs or expenses, caused, directly or
            indirectly, by any malfunction, disruption or failure of any transmission,
            communication system, computer facility or trading software, whether belonging
            to ComfyFX, Customer, any exchange or any settlement or clearing system.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Telephone Orders</b></h4>
            ComfyFX is not responsible for disruption, failure or malfunction of telephone
            facilities and does not guarantee its telephone availability. For the
            avoidance of doubt, Customer is aware that ComfyFX may not be reachable by
            telephone at all times. In such cases Customer shall place his/her order
            through other means offered by ComfyFX.
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Quoting Errors</b></h4>
            Should a quoting error occur (including responses to Customer requests),
            ComfyFX is not liable for any resulting errors in account balances and
            reserves the right to make necessary corrections or adjustments to the
            relevant Account. Any dispute arising from such quoting errors will be
            resolved on the basis of the fair market value, as determined by ComfyFX in
            its sole discretion and acting in good faith, of the relevant market at the
            time such an error occurred. In cases where the prevailing market represents
            prices different from the prices ComfyFX has posted on our screen, ComfyFX
            will attempt, on a best efforts basis, to execute Transactions on or close to
            the prevailing market prices. These prevailing market prices will be the
            prices, which are ultimately reflected on the Customer statements. This may or
            may not adversely affect the Customer’s realized and unrealized gains and
            losses.
