            <p style="font-weight: 500">
              For the purposes of the Policy, money laundering is generally
              defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the
              true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the unlawful
              proceeds appear to have been derived from legitimate origins or
              constitute legitimate assets.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: 500">
              Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first
              enters the financial system at the “placement” stage, where the
              cash generated from criminal activities is converted into monetary
              instruments, such as money orders or traveler’s checks, or
              deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the
              “layering” stage, the funds are transferred or moved into other
              accounts or other financial institutions to further separate the
              money from its criminal origin. At the “integration” stage, the
              funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to purchase
              legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or
              legitimate businesses. Terrorist financing may not involve the
              proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal the
              origin or intended use of the funds, which will later be used for
              criminal purposes.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: 500">
              Each employee of the Company, whose duties are associated with the
