              <p class="txt tc-gblue ts-18">
                It is the policy of Trinity Capital LLC and its affiliates,
                (hereinafter “the Company”) to prohibit and actively pursue the
                prevention of money laundering and any activity that facilitates
                money laundering or the funding of terrorist or criminal
                activities. The Company requires its officers, employees and
                affiliates to adhere to these standards in preventing the use of
                its products and services for money laundering purposes.

                <br /><br />For the purposes of the Policy, money laundering is
                generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or
                disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that
                the unlawful proceeds appear to have been derived from
                legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets.

                <br /><br />Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages.
                Cash first enters the financial system at the “placement” stage,
                where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted
                into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler’s
                checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At
                the “layering” stage, the funds are transferred or moved into
                other accounts or other financial institutions to further
                separate the money from its criminal origin. At the
                “integration” stage, the funds are reintroduced into the economy
                and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal
                activities or legitimate businesses. Terrorist financing may not
                involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt
                to conceal the origin or intended use of the funds, which will
                later be used for criminal purposes.

                <br /><br />Each employee of the Company, whose duties are
                associated with the provision of products and services of the
                Company and who directly or indirectly deals with the clientele
                of the Company, is expected to know the requirements of the
                applicable laws and regulations which affect his or her job
                responsibilities, and it shall be the affirmative duty of such
                employee to carry out these responsibilities at all times in a
                manner that complies with the requirements of the relevant laws
                and regulations.

                <br /><br />The laws and regulations include, but not limited
                to: “Customer Due Diligence for Banks” (2001) and “General Guide
                to Account Opening and Customer Identification” (2003) of Basel
                Committee of banking Supervision, Forty + nine Recommendations
                for Money Laundering of FATF, USA Patriot Act (2001), Prevention
                and Suppression of Money Laundering Activities Law (1996).

                <br /><br />To ensure that this general policy is carried out,
                management of the Company has established and maintains an
                ongoing program for the purpose of assuring compliance with the
                relevant laws and regulations and the prevention of money
                laundering. This program seeks to coordinate the specific
                regulatory requirements throughout the group within a
                consolidated framework in order to effectively manage the
                group’s risk of exposure to money laundering and terrorist
                financing across all business units, functions, and legal
                entities.

                <br /><br />Each of the affiliates of the Company is required to
                comply with AML and KYC policies.

                <br /><br />All identification documentation and services
                records shall be kept for the minimum period of time required by
                local law.

                <br /><br />All new employees shall receive anti-money
                laundering training as part of the mandatory new-hire training
                program. All applicable employees are also required to complete
                AML and KYC training annually. Participation in additional
                targeted training programs is required for all employees with
                day to day AML and KYC responsibilities.
