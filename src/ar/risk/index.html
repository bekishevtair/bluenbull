                  Customer represents, warrants and agrees that Customer
                  understands these risks, is willing and able, financially and
                  otherwise, to assume the risks of trading CFDs and FX
                  Contracts and that the loss of Customer’s entire account

                  rise between the time of the purchase and sale. As owner of a
                  long position, you will generally make a profit if the market
                  price of the underlying rises whilst your CFD long position is
                  open. On the contrary, you will generally suffer a loss, if
                  the market price of the underlying falls whilst your CFD long
                  position is open. Your potential loss may therefore be bigger
                  than the initial margin deposited. In addition, you might
                  suffer a loss due to the closing of your position, in case you
                  do not have enough liquidity for the margin on your account in

                  <b>High Leverage And Low Margin Can Lead To Quick Losses</b>
                </h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The high degree of “gearing” or “leverage” is a particular
                    feature of both CFDs and FX Contracts. The effect of
                    leverage makes investing in CFDs riskier than investing in
                    the underlying asset.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    This stems from the margining system applicable to CFDs
                    which generally involves a small deposit relative to the
                    size of the transaction, so that a relatively small price
                    movement in the underlying asset can have a
                    disproportionately dramatic effect on your trade. This can
                    be both advantageous and disadvantageous. A small price
                    movement in your favour can provide a high return on the
                    deposit, however, a small price movement against you may
                    result in significant losses. Your losses will never exceed
                    the balance of your account, which is balanced to zero, if
                    the losses are higher than the amount deposited. Such losses
                    can occur quickly. The greater the leverage, the greater the
                    risk. The size of leverage therefore partly determines the
                    result of the investment.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Margin Requirements</b></h4>

                <p>
                  Customer must maintain the minimum margin requirement on their
                  open positions at all times. It is Customer’s responsibility
                  to monitor his/her account balance. Customer may receive a
                  margin call to deposit additional cash if the margin in the
                  account concerned is too low. bluenbull has the right to
                  liquidate any or all open positions whenever the minimum
                  margin requirement is not maintained and this may result in
                  Customer’s CFDs or FX Contracts being closed at a loss for
                  which you will be liable.

                    The difference between our bid price and our ask price is
                    “Our Spread”. Our Spreads are set in our absolute
                    discretion, since we are acting as market maker, and any

                <p>
                  Customer understands that CFD and FX Contracts can only be
                  settled in cash and the difference between the buying and
                  selling price partly determines the result of the investment.

                  bluenbull is counterparty to all Transactions entered into
                  under the Customer Agreement and, as such, bluenbull’s

                <h4 style="margin-top: 1em"><b>OTC Transactions</b></h4>

                <p>
                  When trading CFDs or FX Contracts with us, such transactions
                  will not be executed on a recognized or designated investment
                  exchange and are known as OTC transactions. All positions
                  entered into with us must be closed with us and cannot be
                  closed with any other entity. OTC transactions may involve
                  greater risk than investing in on-exchange contracts because
                  there is no exchange market on which to close out an open
                  position. It may be impossible to liquidate an existing
                  position, to assess the value of the position arising from an
                  OTC transaction or to assess the exposure to risk. Bid prices
                  and ask prices may not be quoted by us, based on best
                  execution policies applicable in the market. There is no
                  central clearing and no guarantee by any other party of
                  bluenbull’s payment obligations to the Customer, thus Customer
                  is exposed to credit risk with bluenbull. Customer must look
                  only to bluenbull’s for performance of all contracts in
                  Customer’s account and for return of any margin or collateral.

                    your CFD or FX Contract will depend on the prices set by
                    bluenbull and market fluctuations in the underlying asset to
                    which your contract relates. Each underlying asset therefore
                    carries specific risks that affect the result of the CFD
                    concerned.

                  <li>
                    Our prices for a given market are calculated by reference to
                    the price of the relevant underlying asset which we obtain
                    from third party external reference sources or exchanges.
                    For our CFD and FX Contracts, we obtain price data from
                    wholesale market participants. Although bluenbull expects
                    that these prices will be reasonably related to prices
                    available in the market, bluenbull’s prices may vary from
                    prices available to banks and other market participants.
                    bluenbull has considerable discretion in setting and
                    collecting margin. bluenbull is authorized to convert funds
                    in Customer’s account for margin into and from such foreign
                    currency at a rate of exchange determined by bluenbull in
                    its sole discretion on the basis of then-prevailing money

                  You have no rights or obligations in respect of the underlying

                  The Customer understands that CFDs can have different

                  Investing in FX Contracts and CFDs with an underlying asset
                  listed in a currency other than your base currency entails a
                  currency risk, due to the fact that when the CFD or FX
                  Contract is settled in a currency other than your base
                  currency, the value of your return may be affected by its
                  conversion into the base currency.

                  reflected on the Customer statements. This may or may not
                  adversely affect the Customer’s realized and unrealized gains
