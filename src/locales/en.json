This can be both advantageous and disadvantageous. A small price movement in your favour can provide a high return on the deposit, however, a small price movement against you may result in significant losses. Your losses will never exceed the balance of your account, which is balanced to zero, if the losses are higher than the amount deposited. Such losses can occur quickly.
